This project contains two folders server and client.
So to run the program, you should navigate to server and install all dependencies with command

### `npm install`

and after that run

### `npm start`

command.

The same process is for the client.
I used for client

### `yarn`

You can run frontend and backend server entering only one command:
Navigate to main folder just hit

### `docker-compose up --build`

After that everything is set up.

Enjoy!
